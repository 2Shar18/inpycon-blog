Summary: Nominations open for 2016 Kenneth Gonsalves award

PyCon India 2016 is keeping with the tradition of giving out the annual Kenneth Gonsalves Award.

This award is instituted by PSSI in the name of our late friend and mentor, Kenneth Gonsalves who passed away in August 2012. KG, as he was fondly known in the community, was the founder of the Indian Python Software Society.

This award is given for those who have done exemplary work in the community for development/adoption/advocacy of the Python programming language in India.
