Nominations open for 2016 Kenneth Gonsalves award
-------------------------------------------------
Hey Folks, 

PyCon India 2016 in keeping with the tradition will be giving out the Kenneth Gonsalves 2016 Award.

The award is usually given out to people who have done exceptional work in moving forward the adoption of Python forward in India.

There is always a need to identify figures whom the coming generations can look upto.
For this purpose, and to encourage even further contributions, as well as to motivate
the upcoming generations, we have been consistently awarding the Kenneth Gonsalves award
for the past two years to worthy Indian Pythonistas.

This award is instituted by PSSI (and in the past PSF) in the name of our late friend and mentor,
Kenneth Gonsalves who passed away in August 2012. 

KG, as he is fondly known in the community, was the founder of the Indian Python Software Society.
This award is for the ones who are doing exemplary work in Python programming language,
its development/adoption/advocacy in India.

It is that time of the year, again, where we welcome nominations for a worthy candidate from all of you.
If you know someone who has played a key role in the Indian Python community's development, please nominate their names.
Do your part to help us find a deserving personality to accept the award this year.
