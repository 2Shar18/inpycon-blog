Poster Presentation - Pycon India'2015
======================================

What is Poster Presentation?
============================
Ideally, Poster presentation/session is an informal way to present your ideas, or research information at the conference with an academic focus and reach out to a larger audience on your topic. Basically the poster presentations are different from the soft, projector based presentations, where the  presenter/individual/speaker accompanies a poster, posts it on a black/white board in the space provided, stand there, talk to the rolling audience, explain the concept, take maximum questions on his topic. Each presentation is usually presented over a period of 10 minutes or more. 
Interestingly, at PyCon 2015, Bangalore, we’ll be having the Poster sessions and space will be reserved for the speakers to display their posters.

What is the Motivation behind it?
=================================
Oral presentations are a richer medium than written documents. They allow you to establish stronger contact with the audience and better convince them with your viewpoint through verbal and nonverbal methods, as well as the ensuing interaction. Posters also act as hard copies providing in-depth details of the concepts of a talk a speaker aims to spread, where any participant can look back incase he missed a few pointers during the talk.

Who can Participate?
====================
1. Professionals
2. Lecturers
3. College Students
4. Speakers

What makes a good Poster Presentation?
======================================
First and most important, a good proposal. Poster sessions are intended to give you the chance to present interesting ideas and start conversations with others. Additionally, proposal titles and abstracts are one of the major tools the audience will use to identify posters of interest.
Second, the poster itself. The poster is a visual aid for you to use in creating a quick engaging presentation, and to refer to it answering questions and fuelling discussion.

Few FAQs
========
Q: Can I submit both a poster and a talk proposal?
--------------------------------------------------
A: Absolutely! We encourage everyone to submit a poster proposal even if they have also submitted a talk proposal. If both are accepted, we encourage authors to adapt their presentation to make the best use of each venue. Even if a talk proposal can not be accommodated by the program committee, it may still be well suited for a poster presentation.
