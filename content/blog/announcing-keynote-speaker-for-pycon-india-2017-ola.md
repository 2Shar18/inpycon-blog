[Ola ](https://twitter.com/olasitarska) is a core contributor to the Django Web Framework. She co-founded [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) , a non-profit organization with the aim of teaching programming to women. Started by two girls in Berlin and now organized all over the world, Django Girls aims to inspire women to fall in love with programming.

Ola started programming at the age of 14 and by 16 had founded her first company [Issue Stand](https://issuestand.com/).She started as a PHP developer where she spent  half of her time writing management tools for the websites she created, so other people could modify the content without knowing how to program. She suddenly learned that Django has a feature that does it automatically and in addition, you don’t have to worry too much about security. Considering those advantages and all the spare time she would get building awesome projects she switched to Django and never looked back.In fact in 2013 she was one of the core organizers of DjangoCon Europe 2013.


TechCrunch listed her in Top 100 women in [Tech from Europe](https://techcrunch.com/2012/06/01/girlsintech-pick-their-top-100-women-in-tech-in-europe/) and [50 Inspiring Women in Tech](https://www.improvedigital.com/press-releases/europes-inspiring-women-tech/).


Besides teaching Python, organizing conferences and giving tech talks, she likes to travel and play board games.


Ola will share with you how she went from not knowing anything about teaching programming or feminism to know a little bit more thanks to thousands of people who participated in the workshop formula Django Girls created. You’ll learn the secrets of explaining the Internet, servers or ORM to people who never done this before. And how to find 100+ women who want to learn to code just about anywhere.
