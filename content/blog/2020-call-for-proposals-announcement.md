# Calling all Pythonistas in the world, Call for Proposals for PyCon India 2020 is now open!

That time is upon us again, folks. PyCon India is back and the call for proposals ([https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/)) has officially opened. 2020 has been a rollercoaster for all of us. As this year's PyCon India 2020 is being organized online (Announcement Tweet), we want your support to make the conference bigger, better, and more accessible to all. After all, PyCon India is made by you, for you and with you at its center.

> Divided by Covid. Connected by Python!

So, whether you are someone submitting a proposal for talks for the first time or just want to share what you have been up to with Python this past year. This is YOUR time to shine. 

We are looking forward to seeing beginner, intermediate, and advanced proposals on topics mentioned below from beginner, intermediate, and advanced speakers to present those talks. You don’t need to be a 10-year veteran who has spoken at dozens of conferences. For making our conference truly diverse, we are looking for all kinds of people. That’s what our community is comprised of, and that’s what this conference’s schedule should be made from.

 

Please make note of some important dates as mentioned below:

- CFP opens on **24th April 2020**
- CFP closes on **14th August 2020**
- Schedule shall be released on **1st September 2020**
- Talks will be presented online on **2nd and 3rd October 2020**

## Where should you submit your proposal?

After signing up for an account on [https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/2020/proposals/), you will be redirected to create a **New Proposal** page. Where you can create and submit your proposal. `` 

Do make sure to read the best practices for speakers submitting proposals for the first time!

## Guidelines to be followed for the video

**Duration & orientation**
1 -3 Minute video to be recorded. The video should be recorded preferably in portrait mode.

**Upload to YouTube**
The video has to be uploaded on Youtube. If you don’t want other people to find it, mark it as unlisted. Don’t mark it as private or disallow embedding, or we won’t be able to see it.​

**Only you talking about your talk**
The video should contain nothing except you talking about your talk.​ Try to make a video that holds our attention and helps us understand more deeply about what's your talk is all about. 

**No effects & No Music.**

Please do not add any background music to your video. ​No screenshots or postproduction wizardry please; we don’t want this to turn into a video making contest. If you’re going to spend time making something cool, put that into your slides & proposal

**No Script**
Please do not recite a script written beforehand. Just talk spontaneously as you would to a friend. People delivering memorized speeches (or worse still, text read off the screen) usually come off as dull. Just get in the zone and let your heart do the talking. Be vanilla!

**Check Audio**
Try to keep your voice clear and check that's being recorded properly. Make sure there isn't any background noise. Try to record this in an empty room without much going on in the background.
