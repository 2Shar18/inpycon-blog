Summary: Pycon India 2017 – Community Spaces Announced.

PyCon India is run by volunteer and there have been innumerable people from various python communities from various parts of India who deserve kudos for their efforts in running the event for past nine years.While there have been requests from communities in the past for space, we could not oblige due to space constraints. This year too a lot of communities have asked for an area in the venue to exhibit their work. We are excited to take this opportunity to invite communities that are contributing to the ecosystem of Python to showcase their community/projects activities at PyCon India.

There are multiple ways to showcase your work at PyCon India:

- Take part in [Dev Sprint](https://in.pycon.org/cfp/dev-sprint-2017/proposals/) by submitting a proposal.
- Give a talk at flash talk sessions.
-  Register for a slot in open spaces.
-  Register for a community space

Community space is a place where you can set up a booth on the conference day with two members and a table, you can carry one standee of your community. You are free to hand over stickers, brochures to visitors.This allows you to freely communicate in a relaxed and casual way while showcasing your growing community to other people. 

We believe every community that helps the Python ecosystem should be known to the people.This helps the community in gaining exposure and finding new contributors which in turn makes the whole Python ecosystem stronger. And what could be a better place for this than the premier Python conference of India, PyCon India 2017. Thus community spaces can be obtained free of cost by filling the [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfS0FYzg1BG5uR2xyUKwU4ljLVftak1zkfhJRoCp1AlM8fKQ/viewform).
